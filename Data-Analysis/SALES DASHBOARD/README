SALES INSIGHT ANALYSIS PROJECT REPORT
(From data cleaning → analysis → dashboard storytelling)

This project demonstrates my ability to clean raw sales data, prepare a structured dataset for analysis, create pivot-based metrics, and design an interactive Excel dashboard that provides actionable insights for business decisions.
1. DATA UNDERSTANDING & INITIAL CHECKS
The dataset contained typical sales transactional fields:
•	Order ID
•	Order Date / Month
•	Region
•	Sales Representative
•	Product Category
•	Quantity Sold
•	Revenue
•	Payment Category
•	Customer Type
•	Sales Channel
Before beginning analysis, the dataset required validation and cleaning.

2. DATA CLEANING PROCESS (STEP-BY-STEP)
2.1 Removed Duplicates
•	Checked full dataset for duplicate rows using:
o	Data → Remove Duplicates
•	Ensured unique transactions per Order ID.
2.2 Checked for Missing Values
•	Ensured no blank values in:
o	Region
o	Sales Rep
o	Product Category
o	Revenue
o	Quantity
Any missing values were replaced using:
•	Forward-fill for categorical fields
•	Zero or median for numerical fields, depending on context
2.3 Ensured Correct Data Types
•	Converted Revenue and Quantity fields to Number.
•	Converted Order Date to proper Date format.
•	Extracted:
o	Month
o	Year
o	Quarter
2.4 Standardized Categories
To avoid inconsistencies:
•	Uniform spellings for regions (East, West, North, South)
•	Standardized payment types (Cash, Credit Card, Bank Transfer)
•	Cleaned customer type values (New vs Returning)
2.5 Created Helper Columns (Where Needed)
•	Region + Sales Rep combined field for the filter slicer.
Formula example:
=[@Region] & "-" & [@[Sales Rep]]
After cleaning, the dataset was now analysis-ready.

3. DATA MODEL STRUCTURE
Because the analysis was built in Excel, I used:
1 Main Fact Table:
Sales_Data
•	Transaction-level data (Revenue, Quantity, Order Date, etc.)
1 Lookup Table:
Date Table (optional but recommended)
•	Contains Month Name, Month Number, Year, Quarter
•	Ensures clean time-series analysis
The tables were converted to Excel Tables using CTRL+T, which makes pivoting easier.
No advanced modeling needed — Excel handles relationships automatically.

4. ANALYTICAL CALCULATIONS USING PIVOT TABLES
4.1 Revenue by Region
Pivot table fields:
•	Rows: Region
•	Values: Sum of Revenue
4.2 Payment Category Usage
Pivot table:
•	Rows: Payment Category
•	Values: Count of Order ID
4.3 Total Quantity Sold by Product Category
Pivot:
•	Rows: Product Category
•	Values: Sum of Quantity
4.4 Total Revenue by Customer Type
Pivot:
•	Rows: Customer Type
•	Values: Sum of Revenue
4.5 Revenue by Month
Pivot:
•	Rows: Month
•	Values: Sum of Revenue
•	Sort by Month Number for correct order

4.6 Total Sales by Sales Rep
Pivot:
•	Rows: Sales Rep
•	Values: Sum of Revenue
4.7 Revenue by Sales Channel
Pivot:
•	Rows: Sales Channel
•	Values: Sum of Revenue
4.8 Interactive Slicers
Added slicers for:
•	Region
•	Month
•	Combined Region + Sales Rep
These slicers control all charts and allow interactive exploration.

5. DASHBOARD DESIGN & VISUALIZATION CHOICES
Charts Used & Why
•	Bar Chart: Revenue by region — best for comparing categories.
•	Pie Charts: Payment method & customer type — best for proportions.
•	Horizontal Bar: Product category quantity — easy comparison.
•	Line Chart: Revenue by month — ideal for time trends.
•	Column Chart: Sales rep performance — easy ranking.
•	Doughnut Chart: Revenue by channel — clean segmentation.
Design Elements
•	Soft pink background for consistent branding
•	Rounded border shapes around each chart for clarity
•	Uniform font and chart colors for readability
•	Slicers placed at the right for user control

6. KEY INSIGHTS DISCOVERED
1. Highest Revenue Region: NORTH
•	North recorded the strongest performance, exceeding $1.35M.
2. Best Sales Rep: DAVID
•	David generated over $1.1M, outperforming others by a large margin.
3. Customer Mix is Almost Even
•	New customers: $2.513M
•	Returning customers: $2.506M
→ Showing strong customer retention.
4. Payment Preference: CREDIT CARD
•	345 transactions were made using credit cards
•	Slightly more than bank transfer and cash
5. Product Category with Largest Quantity Sold: CLOTHING
•	Clothing reached nearly 8,000 units
•	Followed by Furniture and Electronics
6. Revenue Trend
•	Revenue fluctuates monthly
•	Peak around January and October
7. Sales Channels
•	Retail: 51%
•	Online: 49%
→ Balanced channel performance, opportunities for growth in both.

7. PROJECT SUMMARY FOR PORTFOLIO
