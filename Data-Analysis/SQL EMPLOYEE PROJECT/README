SQL EMPLOYEE DATABASE ANALYSIS
Project Overview

In this project, I explored the Employees Relational Database, a classic dataset that simulates a real corporate HR system containing:
Employee personal details
Salaries
Departments
Department managers
Job titles

Using MySQL, I wrote a series of SQL queries to analyze employee demographics, hiring trends, salary data, department structures, and managerial assignments.
The project demonstrates strong hands-on experience with data retrieval, filtering, aggregation, joins, subsetting, table manipulation, and exploratory analysis.

Objectives of the Analysis
My goal was to demonstrate proficiency in:
Filtering and retrieving records
Pattern matching using SQL operators
Grouping and aggregation
Joining multiple related tables
Modifying and cleaning database structures
Analyzing salary distributions
Understanding department-manager relationships
Working with subqueries and set operators
This report walks through each SQL technique and explains exactly what I achieved.

1. Basic Data Retrieval
I started by exploring the database structure:
SELECT dept_no FROM departments;
SELECT * FROM departments;
This allowed me to view department codes and confirm the schema layout.

2. Conditional Filtering (WHERE Clause)
Filtering by First Name
Examples:
SELECT * FROM employees WHERE first_name = 'Elvis';
SELECT * FROM employees WHERE first_name = 'Kellie' AND gender='f';
→ This showed employees meeting specific conditions such as name, gender, or both.
Using OR
SELECT * FROM employees WHERE first_name='kellie' OR first_name='elvis';
→ Demonstrated how to retrieve multiple conditions in one query.

3. Using IN and NOT IN
SELECT * FROM employees WHERE first_name IN ('denis','elvis');
SELECT * FROM employees WHERE first_name NOT IN ('John','Mark','Jacob');
→ Useful for selecting or excluding multiple values at once.

4. Pattern Matching with LIKE
I practiced extracting records based on partial text patterns.
Examples:
Names starting with 'Mark'
SELECT * FROM employees WHERE first_name LIKE 'Mark%';
Employees hired in the year 2000
SELECT * FROM employees WHERE hire_date LIKE '%2000%';
Employee number pattern
SELECT * FROM employees WHERE emp_no LIKE '1000_';
Names containing or not containing “Jack”
SELECT * FROM employees WHERE first_name LIKE '%jack%';
SELECT * FROM employees WHERE first_name NOT LIKE '%jack%';
→ Showcases fluency with string matching.

5. Range Filtering with BETWEEN
SELECT * FROM salaries WHERE salary BETWEEN 66000 AND 70000;
SELECT * FROM employees WHERE emp_no NOT BETWEEN '10004' AND '10012';
SELECT dept_name FROM departments WHERE dept_no BETWEEN 'd003' AND 'd006';
→ Used to find employees or departments within or outside numerical/alphabetical ranges.

6. Checking for NULL Values
SELECT dept_name FROM departments WHERE dept_no IS NOT NULL;
→ Demonstrates understanding of NULL logic.

7. Additional Conditional Practice
Females hired after 2000:
SELECT * FROM employees 
WHERE hire_date >= '2000-01-01' AND gender='F';
Salaries greater than 150k:
SELECT * FROM salaries WHERE salary > 150000;

8. DISTINCT Values
SELECT DISTINCT gender FROM employees;
SELECT DISTINCT hire_date FROM employees;
→ Useful for identifying unique values and category exploration.

9. Aggregation & Counting
Number of high-value contracts:
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM salaries WHERE salary >= 100000;
Number of managers:
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM dept_manager;

10. Sorting (ORDER BY)
SELECT * FROM employees ORDER BY hire_date DESC;
→ Helps analyze hiring patterns over time.

11. GROUP BY + HAVING (Advanced Filtering)
Employees with salaries > 80k grouped by salary:
SELECT salary, COUNT(emp_no) AS emps_with_same_salary
FROM salaries
WHERE salary > 80000
GROUP BY salary
ORDER BY salary ASC;

Employees whose average salary > 120k:
SELECT emp_no, AVG(salary) AS average_salary
FROM salaries
GROUP BY emp_no
HAVING AVG(salary) > 120000;

→ Shows advanced grouping, aggregation, and filtering.

12. Table Structure Modifications (ALTER TABLE)
ALTER TABLE departments_dup DROP COLUMN dept_manager;
ALTER TABLE departments_dup CHANGE COLUMN dept_no dept_no CHAR(4) NULL;
→ Demonstrates ability to modify database schema.

13. Creating and Populating Tables
I created a duplicate manager table:
CREATE TABLE dept_manager_dup (...);
INSERT INTO dept_manager_dup SELECT * FROM dept_manager;
Inserted new rows, and deleted some:
DELETE FROM dept_manager_dup WHERE dept_no='d001';
→ Shows data insertion, migration, and cleanup.

14. JOIN Operations (Core of Relational Analysis)
INNER JOIN – Employee details with manager department:
SELECT 
    e.emp_no, e.first_name, e.last_name, dm.dept_no, e.hire_date
FROM employees e
JOIN dept_manager dm ON e.emp_no = dm.emp_no;

LEFT JOIN – Retrieve employees even if not managers:
SELECT 
    e.emp_no, e.first_name, e.last_name, dm.dept_no, dm.from_date
FROM employees e
LEFT JOIN dept_manager dm ON e.emp_no = dm.emp_no
WHERE e.last_name = 'Markovitch';

3-Table JOIN:
SELECT 
    e.first_name,
    e.last_name,
    e.hire_date,
    m.from_date,
    d.dept_name
FROM employees e
JOIN dept_manager m ON e.emp_no = m.emp_no
JOIN departments d ON m.dept_no = d.dept_no;

4-Table JOIN (Employees, Manager, Departments, Titles)
SELECT 
    e.first_name,
    e.last_name,
    e.hire_date,
    t.title,
    dm.from_date AS start_date,
    d.dept_name
FROM employees e
JOIN dept_manager dm ON e.emp_no = dm.emp_no
JOIN departments d ON d.dept_no = dm.dept_no
JOIN titles t ON t.emp_no = dm.emp_no;

→ Demonstrates advanced, multi-table relational querying.

15. CROSS JOIN examples

Used to generate all possible combinations between tables.

SELECT dm.*, d.*
FROM departments d
CROSS JOIN dept_manager dm
WHERE d.dept_no = 'd009';

→ Useful for pairing every manager with possible departments.

16. Salary Analysis by Gender
SELECT e.gender, AVG(s.salary) AS average_salary
FROM employees e
JOIN salaries s ON e.emp_no = s.emp_no
GROUP BY gender;

→ Demonstrates demographic salary comparison.
