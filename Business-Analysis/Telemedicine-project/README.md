This study investigated the challenges and impact of telehealth services on the health status of students at the University of Lagos (UNILAG) and its College of Medicine (CMUL). Amid rising healthcare demands and limited on-campus health resources, telehealth presents a transformative opportunity for enhancing student wellness and healthcare accessibility. The research employed a descriptive survey design, with data collected through structured questionnaires distributed to a representative sample of students across both institutions. The study explored five core areas: awareness and perception of telehealth, factors influencing its utilisation, the impact of telehealth on students’ health status, and utilisation challenges.

Quantitative analysis, including independent samples t-tests, was used to compare responses between UNILAG and CMUL students regarding awareness, perceived health impact, and experienced challenges. The findings revealed a significant difference in awareness and utilisation patterns between the two institutions, influenced by discipline-specific exposure and access to medical infrastructure. Despite moderate adoption rates, students reported improved access to mental health support, reduced wait times for consultations, and better management of chronic conditions. However, challenges such as digital illiteracy, inconsistent internet access, data privacy concerns, and scepticism about the quality of virtual consultations remain prevalent.

The study concludes that while telehealth holds immense potential to enhance healthcare delivery within university environments, its success hinges on addressing systemic and infrastructural challenges. Recommendations include increasing awareness campaigns, investing in digital infrastructure, and integrating telehealth into institutional health policies. This research provided evidence-based insights that may inform the development of scalable telehealth models tailored to academic communities, thereby contributing to improved health outcomes and educational attainment.
