As the Project Manager, I created and managed all critical project documents from initiation to closure. These documents ensured clarity, alignment, risk control, and successful delivery.

1. Core Project Documents

Project Charter: Defined the project goals, scope, stakeholders, timeline, and approval structure.

Business Requirements Document (BRD):Captured all functional and non-functional requirements for both the website and documentary.

Risk Register: Identified project risks, their potential impacts, probability scores, mitigation strategies, and risk owners.

Stakeholder Register:Documented all key stakeholders, their roles, influence, communication needs, and engagement strategy.

Communication Plan:Outlined how project information would flow — frequency, channels, audience, and formats.

Project Scope Statement: Clear in-scope and out-of-scope boundaries for the website and documentary.

Work Breakdown Structure (WBS): Broke the entire project into manageable, trackable components.

Project Schedule / Timeline: A detailed timeline of all tasks, phases, and milestones.

RACI Matrix:Defined roles, responsibilities, accountability, and consultation structure.

Requirements Traceability Matrix (RTM):Ensured every requirement from interviews and discovery sessions was captured and implemented.

Production Plan (for the documentary): Included shooting schedule, interview plans, location listing, production resources, and technical setup.

Change Log:Captured all requested or implemented changes and how they affected scope, cost, and timelines.

Quality Assurance Plan:Defined quality expectations for video production, website design, content accuracy, and testing.

Issue Log:Tracked issues encountered during filming, editing, and development, along with resolution steps.

Meeting Notes & Weekly Status Reports:Provided updates on progress, blockers, decisions, and next steps.

These documents collectively provided governance, clarity, and direction for the project.

2. My Project Execution Approach

2.1 Requirements Gathering
Conducted interviews with the sponsor and supporting team.
Collected content needs, UI/UI expectations, documentary objectives, and branding guidelines.
Identified required features for the website (biography, achievements timeline, gallery, video integration, etc.).

2.2 Development of Project Charter
Established vision, objectives, scope, timeline, and success criteria.
Identified high-level risks and constraints.
Aligned expectations with the sponsor to reduce scope creep.

2.3 Stakeholder Identification & Engagement
Mapped all stakeholders: sponsor, production crew, editors, web developers, design team, and interview subjects.
Documented roles and influence levels.
Set clear communication expectations and approval levels.

2.4 Team Mobilization
Formed both the documentary production team and website development team.
Clarified responsibilities using a RACI matrix.
Set up communication channels (WhatsApp, email, weekly stand-ups).

2.5 Project Planning & Scheduling
Created a detailed Work Breakdown Structure (WBS).
Established timelines for filming, editing, content writing, website UI design, and deployment.
Mapped dependencies (e.g., website couldn’t be finalized without documentary assets).

2.6 Risk Identification & Mitigation
Built a detailed risk register.
Anticipated schedule risks, technical risks, content availability risks, and approval risks.
Implemented preventive strategies — backups, early scheduling, milestone approvals.

2.7 Production Execution (Documentary)
Conducted interviews, b-roll shoots, motion graphics planning.
Ensured all audio, lighting, and camera setups adhered to quality standards.
Reviewed footage daily and backed up all media.

2.8 Website Development Execution
Managed UI/UX prototype creation and approval.
Oversaw development of pages: biography, achievements, gallery, testimonials, documentary page.
Supervised content uploading, video embedding, performance optimization, and responsive testing.

2.9 Communication & Progress Monitoring
Held daily or weekly team standups.
Provided weekly status reports to the sponsor.
Issued progress meeting notes and action points.
Ensured all changes were logged and approved.

2.10 Quality Assurance
Conducted content quality checks (accuracy of biography, achievements, academic details).
Reviewed edited documentary cuts and provided structured feedback.
Performed cross-device website testing (mobile, tablet, desktop).
Ensured proper audio, video, and image optimization.

2.11 Final Delivery & Closure
Presented the final website and documentary for approval.
Ensured all issues and pending tasks were resolved.
Delivered final files, documentation, and hosting credentials.
Conducted a closure meeting with sponsor and team.
Archived documents and finalized the project report.

This project showcased full-cycle project management — from initiation to delivery. The combination of structured documentation, risk-awareness, stakeholder engagement, communication discipline, and rigorous quality control ensured the successful delivery of both the documentary and the personal profile website for Professor Grace Otinwa.
